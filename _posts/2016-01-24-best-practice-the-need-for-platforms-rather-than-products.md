description: "By Peter Aylett, Archimedia Middle East. Back in 2010, I had a slide in one of my technology trends presentations that asked 'Are people making product choices or platform choices?' How far this has now evolved was really brought home to me a few days ago when I visited a customer for whom we had installed a system seven years ago."
